# AngularCanvasProject

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 15.2.0.
It is my solution to a problem given by company for a job recruitment.

This application create canvas and let you can draw convex polygon and check if any other point you select is inside or outside that polygon.

There is an input field where you enter number of vertices of the polygon. Then you can draw polygon by mouse clicking on canvas.
If the created polygon is convex you can select more points to check if that point is inside or outside of polygon.
If the created polygon is concav, canvas will reset. For reseting canvas manually there is a reset button.

## Development server

Open folder with any code editor (Visual Studio Code) then run 'npm install' in terminal, this will create necessary files for running the app.
After that run 'ng serve' and you will get localhost address where your app is running.
